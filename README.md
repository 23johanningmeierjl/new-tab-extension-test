## My New Tab - an extension for Google Chrome (or other Chromium browsers)

### A basic and minimalistic new tab extension for Chrome built from HTML 5, CSS, and JavaScript.

Based on [Neverfade Time and Date](https://github.com/dev23jjl/timeanddate).

That should change your New Tab to a Neverfade Time and Date like clock! ;)
