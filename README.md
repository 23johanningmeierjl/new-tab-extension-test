## My New Tab - an extension for Google Chrome (or other Chromium browsers)

### A basic and minimalistic new tab extension for Chrome built from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Based on [Time and Date](https://github.com/dev23jjl/timeanddate).

To use, download repository files.

Go to chrome://extensions

Turn on developer mode

Click load unpacked

Select the extension folder

That should change your New Tab to a "Time and Date"-like clock! ðŸ˜‰

(Or, just don't waste your time with this pathetic excuse of a new tab extension)
